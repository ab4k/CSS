    <h3> <span class="answer">A.</span> CSS Selectors are addresses of the targets which we have to style using css
        properties. </h3>
    <h2 class="subheading-text">Universal Selector</h2>
    <p>There are various ways to select the html elements, so we can style the elements as per our requirement. We can
        select the html elements using individual selctors like the tag names, h1, p, div, span, etc. In this case all
        the elements having the same tag will get selected and the style will be applied. If we want to select the
        entire html we can use universal selector, to select the entire page at a time we have to use * (asterisk). The
        universal selector is mostly used for the resetting of default browser styling. Here is the example of css
        universal selector:</p>

    <div class="white-border">

        <img src="images/universal_selector.png" alt="Code snippet">
        <p>Output :</p>
        <img id="output" src="images/output_uni_selector.png" alt="Output of the code snippet">
    </div>


    <h2 class="subheading-text">Individual Selector</h2>
    <p>Individually the html elements can be selected by tags, classes, ids etc. Classes can be used multiple times
        on a
        webpage for applying same style on multiple similar elements but, ids can be used only once each page. Ids
        has
        more preference over classes.</p>

    <p class="red" id="blue">Red or Blue</p>

    <p>The class of above paragraph is red, and id of blue, according to preference the color as per id is applied,
        so
        the text shown is of blue color.</p>

    <img src="images/class_id_preference.png" alt="Code Snippet having class and id">

    <p>Class Selector Styling:</p>

    <img src="images/class_selector.png" alt="class Selector code snippet">

    <p>Id Selector Styling:</p>
    <img src="images/id_selector.png" alt="id Selector code snippet">

    <h2 class="subheading-text">And Selector</h2>

    <p>And selector acts just like the AND logic, it will work only when both the selectors present in the html
        element.
        In example below, the first sentence having both class yellow and underlined, so the css must have both the
        class
        selectors to select the first sentence.</p>

    <div class="white-border">

        <p>Styling:</p>

        <img src="images/AND_selector_output_1.png">

        <p>Output:</p>

        <div class="yellow underlined-text">First Sentence: This sentence is yellow and underlined.</div>

        <p>If we will use only yellow class selector then the second sentence will be selected but not first.</p>

        <p>Styling:</p>

        <img src="images/AND_selector_output_2.png">

        <p>Output:</p>

        <div class="yellow">Second Sentence: This sentence is only yellow but not underlined.</div>

    </div>

    <h2 class="subheading-text">Selecting element inside an element</h2>
    <p>Suppose, there is a div inside a section and we have to apply certain styling on it, in this scenario we are
        selecting an element inside an element. This can be done as follows:</p>

    <p>"parent_selector child_selector"</p>

    <p>We have to target the parent element first and after the parent the child element we want to select, in between
        we have to write the space. Code example is given below along with the output:</p>

    <h2 class="subheading-text">Descendant Selector</h2>

    <img src="images/inside_element.png" alt="html code snippet">

    <p>Styling:</p>

    <img src="images/magenta_child.png" alt="">

    <section>I am a section and parent of two divs.
        <div>I am a child div.</div>
        <div>I am another child div.</div>
    </section>
    <div>I am a div not a child of the section.</div>


    <p>Descendant selectors are used to select the children of the parent.</p>
    <p>We can easily see that the magenta color is only applied to the child elements and the div outside section is
        unaffected.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading-text">Child Selector</h2>
    <p>Below code snippet is the structure of the parent child and grandchild classes.</p>
    <img src="images/descendant_and_child_html.png">

    <p>Child selectors are used to select the immediate child.</p>

    <img src="images/child_selector.png">

    <div class="parent">I am a parent.
        <div class="child">I am first child.
            <div class="grandchild">
                I am grandchild.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="child">I am second child.
            <div class="grandchild">
                I am another grandchild.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We can see the above code is selecting the immediate child, i.e. first and second child of the parent and the
        style is applied to them.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading-text">Descendant Selector</h2>
    <p>Descendant Selectors are used to select the descendants of the parent. The below code snippet will select the
        child of child selector.
    </p>

    <img src="images/descendant_seletor.png">

    <p>According to our css, the red color is applied to the</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <li>3</li>
        <li>4</li>
        <li>5</li>
    </ul>
